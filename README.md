# Sealed Pool Analyzer

Absolutely gross at currest status, I know.

Requires deck and pool files in the CSV export from Decked Builder.

## Todo

* Accept multiple file formats from deck and pool uploads
* Accept public deck and pool URL
* Better UI design
* Clean up code. A lot.
* Add any amount of tests
* Use mana symbols instead of text
